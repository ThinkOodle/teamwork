# Teamwork Gem

Teamwork is project management software for teams.  This gem attempts to get as close to 100% coverage for the API as possible,
with a few notable holes being uploading files and managing companies.  I would welcome any pull-request that add these capabilities.

## Usage

To get started add `gem "teamworkpm"` to your `Gemfile` (if using Bundler) or run `gem install teamworkpm`.

In order to use the `teamworkpm` gem you will need to have an active teamwork account with full API access.  You can read the docs
on getting your API key [here](http://developer.teamwork.com/enabletheapiandgetyourkey).

### Authentication

Authentication to the API is done through the class method `authenticate`.  `Teamwork.authenticate(api_key)` will log you in.  Failed authentication will return a `401`, else the account for the authenticated user.

### Capabilites

#### Account

GET the authenticated users's information
Return Teamwork::Thing

    Teamwork.account_info


GET an authenticated user
This part is unique to the rest of the lib
in that it uses a different path for the API call.
What we can get from this, however, is the subdomain that the
user is a part of and store that for future API calls.
http://authenticate.teamworkpm.net/authenticate.json
Return Teamwork::Thing (or 401 if auth fails)

    Teamwwork.authenticate(api_key)

#### Activity

GET the recent activity stream across all projects
Return [Teamwork::Thing]

    Teamwork.recent_activity(options) # Defaults to returning 60 items

#### Comment

GET comments for a given resource
params:
  resource: String (links, milestones, files, notebooks, tasks)
  id: UnsignedInt (the id of the resource that you want to get comments on)
options:
  page: UnsignedInt
  pageSize: UnsignedInt (default 50)
return: [Teamwork::Thing]

    Teamwork.get_comments(resource, id, options = {})
